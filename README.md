#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to build a binary classifier to classify images as ‘damage’ or ‘no_damage’ by using a combination of CNNs and transfer learning.

### Methods Used
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* TensorFlow2
* Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy

### Models used:
* Basic CNN model
* AlexNet: AlexNet is a deep learning model and it is a variant of the convolutional neural network. This model was proposed by Alex Krizhevsky as his [research work](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf).
* VGG16 (Fine tuned as well)
* Resnet50 (also fine tuned and with decaying learning rate)
* MobileNet
